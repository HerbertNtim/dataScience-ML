## Overview

This repository showcases my **hands-on learning journey in Data Science and Machine Learning**.  
It contains well-documented code, concept explanations, and practical implementations developed while learning alongside a tutor.

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Strong understanding of **fundamental concepts**
- Ability to **translate theory into code**
- Clean, readable, and well-commented Python implementations
- Continuous improvement and learning mindset

This repository is intentionally focused on **clarity, correctness, and learning depth**, rather than production deployment.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python for Data Science  
- Data Analysis and Manipulation (NumPy, Pandas)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Statistics & Probability for ML  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering & Preprocessing  
- Machine Learning Algorithms  
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics  

---

## Machine Learning Coverage

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- Decision Trees  

### Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering Algorithms  
- Dimensionality Reduction Techniques  

Each implementation includes:
- Clear problem definition  
- Step-by-step logic  
- In-line comments explaining decisions  
- Evaluation and interpretation of results  

---

## Learning Methodology

- Concepts are learned with structured guidance from a tutor  
- Algorithms are implemented and tested with real datasets  
- Emphasis on **understanding over memorization**  
- Code is revisited and improved as knowledge deepens  

This reflects how I approach new technologies in real-world settings: learn → apply → refine.

---

## For Recruiters

This repository demonstrates my ability to:
- Learn complex technical concepts quickly  
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code  
- Apply mathematical and statistical reasoning  
- Communicate technical ideas clearly through documentation  
- Stay consistent and disciplined in long-term learning  

While this is not a production repository, it accurately reflects my **problem-solving approach, technical growth, and learning rigor**.
